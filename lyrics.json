{"lyrics":[{"title":"Greece To San Francisco","text":"I wanna do more than just watch my reflection in the tv screen\nDon't wanna just bide time;\nSo much out there to be seen:\nI won't live my life collecting raindrops in my hands\nWhen i haven't seen sunshine, besides over the same old town.\n\nI can't settle, not when this old, \ntill I've seen Greece to San Francisco;\nI'll have time to worry all my life\n\nI can't settle, not when this old, \ntill I've seen Greece to San Francisco;\nI'll have time to worry all my life\n\nI love misplaced faith;\nAnd we go walking, often hand in hand\nI'm sad to leave her;\nShe made me such a happy man\nBut her I'll sacrifice, and leave her jilted, broken hearted\nAnd I'll go lonely, without her fingers knotted in my hand\n\nThough i may be rushing, and I know much too bold,\nI just want you to trust me;\nSome things I must learn on my own;\n\nI can't settle, not when this old, \ntill I've seen Greece to San Francisco;\nI'll have time to worry all my life\n\nI can't settle, not when this old, \ntill I've seen Greece to San Francisco;\nI'll have time to worry all my life\n\nI can't settle, not when this old, \ntill I've seen Greece to San Francisco;\nI'll have time to worry all my life"},{"title":"Just Like You","text":"Tell me how hard I squeeze \nTo hold on to a good thing\nIt'd kill me to know I'm \nDigging my nails in your skin\nMaybe the coast seems so far away;\nBut i've got enough love \nFor us both these days\nDarling I know how you hate goodbyes;\nBut you wrote that that's the same moon in the sky\nAnd sleeping beneath it; distance can't change\nSome things stay the same\n\nWhen a plane fly's by\nJust know that I\nWill just as easily \nCome and see you\n\nAnd when the sun sets west,\nJust send your best\nCause in only 2 hours;\nI'll see it too;\nSee it just like you\nJust like you\n\nI'm starting to think that\nMaybe love can't be summed up;\nThere's no way you're just\nChemicals in my brain;\nI'll try to put love in the things that I say\nMaybe a song will come for a change\nEven when apart for months \nAnd I'm dying just to see you one\nI'll still say;\nI can't complain\n\nWhen a plane fly's by\nJust know that I\nWill just as easily \nCome and see you\n\nWhen the sun sets west, just send your best\ncause in only 2 hours;\nI'll see it too;\nSee it just like you;\nJust like you\n\nWhen a plane fly's by\nJust know that I\nWill just as easily \nCome and see you\n\nJust hold on,\nYou've got his song\nI'll try to love no matter what I go through\nSo I'll be just like you\nJust like you\nJust like you\nI wanna be just like you."},{"title":"Alone","text":"When I was younger I thought;\nI'd be stronger now\nThought the fires would burn\nUp all my doubts\nI thought they'd consume, leaving me behind\n\nI thought troubles I face;\nWould seem small by now\nLike little speed bumps;\nI'd just step around\n\nBut every fire we douse, another one lights\nI think I just might\n\nHave to go there alone\ngo there alone\nHave to go there alone\nyeah go there alone\n\nI've heard of sands;\nthat can rip your skin\nThings make you bleed;\nNever bow to them\nGod knows they'll burn \nooh oh, just keep pushin' ahead\n\nWhen I was younger I though;\nI should never flinch\nI thought take it with grace;\nMeant keep bruises hid\n\nBut every bone I broke, \nI got more scarred\nBut then they grew hard\n\nOoh you'll burn, bleed, cut your skin to the bones\nOoh you'll burn, bleed, cut your skin to the bones\nOoh you'll burn, bleed, cut your skin to the bones\nThen you'll know\n\nI've gotta go there alone\ngo there alone\nI've gotta there alone\nyeah go there alone"},{"title":"Icarus","text":"I've been chasing after things,\nThat always bring me to my knees,\nI might as well be chasing the whole sun\nI've been chasing after love,\nThen cursing up at that ol' sun,\nIt always seems to be so far away\n\nBut I've been wrong, wrong, wrong\nI shouldn't run, run, run\nBut I don't think it will just just fall in my lap\n\nIf I give it my all\nI've always thought \nThat it'd work out\n\nSo I'll scrape up my bare skin\nAnd try to force some love in\nBut it's not that easy\nNo it's that easy\n\nWhen you leave your heart out on the line\nYou lose a little bit each time\nIt gets left out there;\nSitting in the rain;\nBut even kings are meant to fall\nSo I guess I'll just take it all\nThough I hate it being this way\n\nI know its wrong, wrong, wrong\nBut I'll still run, run, run\nCause I don't think love will just fall in my lap\n\nSo I'll give it my all\nAnd hope that it will work out\nYeah, sharpen your best knife\nJust please don't cut up me tonight\nPlease just let me be tonight\n\nFeels like, wasted love and wasted time\nThis is what I call mine\nI just want to call myself fine\nWasted love and wasted time\nThis is what I call mine\nI just want to call myself fine\n\nI know it's wrong, wrong, wrong\nBut i'll still run, run, run\nCause I wasn't taught anything will just fall in my lap\n\nIf I give it my all\nI've always thought \nThat it'd work out\n\nSo I'll scrape up my bare skin\nTake every loss for just one win\nI'd take 50 losses for just one win\n\nLet's build some wings up you and I\nSee if we can really fly\nI think that we can keep ourselves aflight\nLet's build some wings up you and I\nI think that we could touch the sky\nI hope that we can do it if we try\nLet's build some wings up you and I\nSee if we can really fly\nI think that we can do it if we try"},{"title":"Giants on Giants","text":"Today I climbed a mountain\nWell I guess I took the train\nAnd I went to an island discovered a hundred years ago\nI did it all\nScribbled my name on subway walls\nFilled empty pages\nAnd I yelled and I screamed\nAnd I scratched out my name on these trees\nThey're older than me\nThey're older than me\n\nCause were standing on the shoulders of Giants\nJust look down\nYou'd see how high it is\nYeah just look down\nI'm scared how high it is\n\nToday I wrote a song\nThank god for my guitar\nAnd thank the other people\nThough I'm not sure who they are\nThey did it all\nScribbled their names on subway walls\nFilled empty pages, they all yelled and they cried,\nAnd they scratched out their name on these trees\nThey're older than me\nThey're older than me\n\nCause were standing on the shoulders of giants\nMaybe look down\nYou'd see how high it is\nYeah just look down\nYou'd see how high it is\n\nClimb so high\nFall so far\nGuess either way, were gunna see some stars\nWe climb so high \nCould fall so far\nGuess either way, were gunna see some stars\n\nYeah were standing on the shoulders of giants and giants\nJust look down\nYou'd see how high it is\nPlease look down\nYou'd see how high it is\nYou'd see how high it is"}]}
