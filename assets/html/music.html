                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        I grew up right at the edge of the suburb line outside Minneapolis, Minnesota.  
                        As a person, I’ve always wanted to be able to impact people in a meaningful and
                        thoughtful way.  Originally, this led me to studying to become an English teacher.  
                        During my first semester it seemed the more busy I became with school, the more 
                        I worked on my music.  I decided to take a step back for a while and figure out 
                        where to go from there.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I took some time off school and moved to Denver, unsure how to reach people I’d 
                        never met with my music.  I remembered the previous summer I’d spent backpacking
                        Europe by myself.  I wasn’t sure how to meet people, but it ended up being through
                        my music.  I’d play in the courtyard of the hostels I stayed at, or street perform
                        when I worked up the courage, and people began to approach me.  They’d disregard 
                        that little voice in their head that says you just don’t do certain things like talk 
                        to the stranger playing his guitar on the street.  I was able to disarm and meet 
                        people that I never would otherwise, and it was so easy.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Eventually I began street performing in Denver and it had the same effect.  I drove 
                        up and down the west coast the next summer.  I was playing shows, street performing, 
                        sleeping in my car, and on anyone’s couch who would have me.  Some nights were amazing, 
                        others were lonely, but I loved it.  It was life affirming.  I was able to connect with
                        strangers and people more meaningfully than I ever imagined.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I suppose thats what I’m still trying to do.
