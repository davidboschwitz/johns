                        With the release his self titled EP, John Lensing brings a modern thoughtfulness to a classic genre. Lush with addicting guitar progressions, and soulful vocals; the record manages to bridge the gap between eloquently introspective and plainly spoken
                        Indie Folk. Though the songs are diverse from one another, there is a glue that holds it all together much like a concept album would. Most importantly, the record never loses sight of the emotional platform great songs are built
                        from.

                        The first single, “Alone” is an instant folk pop classic. Complete with an ambient atmosphere, refreshing vocal melodies, and rolling almost jazz style percussion, the song seems to breathe and build as it plays on.

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        “The song ‘Alone’ is of significance because it represents a bit of a tenacity that I've built up during my recent life. High school for me involved getting in a few relationships, and immersing myself in them probably quicker than I should have. My personality
                        mixed with my naivety to that aspect of life led to me experiencing some very abrupt highs as well as lows. I came out of it realizing that people who are extremely important to you can come and go from your life more easily than
                        you expect. This realization simultaneously was jarring and freeing.” explains the songwriter of his single.

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        Although the single does speak volumes for the EP, to get a real understanding of where Lensing is coming from, it should be heard in its entirety.
                    </p>

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        “I think the songwriting is what sets me apart. I've spent a lot to time trying to be able to express my ideas and feelings in a way that is genuine to me. It's always been important to me that what I'm singing is in my own vernacular. I believe this
                        really is shown in my work, and think this album really sets a good foundation for my music. I can't wait to build upon what I've made with future releases.” says Lensing of the EP itself.

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        Coming from a very musical background, John Lensing was interested in music since he was just a kid. Taking years of piano lessons growing up and even a bit of baritone, the songwriter always felt drawn to music, though not sure of his reasons. He was
                        learning to play the guitar, upright bass, electric bass, and even taking voice lessons though felt a bit lost, unsure of what he wanted out of it. Inspired initially by the strong local Minneapolis hip hop scene, he actually began
                        his songwriting in the form of writing rap lyrics. Wanting to improve, he made a rule for himself making sure he wrote at least a page of lyrics before he would go to sleep at night. Although this rule he came up with was a difficult
                        one at first, it helped him hone in on lyric writing.

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        Though initially very shy to share his music, Lensing eventually brought in his notebook that he had nearly filled completely with lyrics. With the encouragement of his teacher, they began working on bass riffs to practice the with, bouncing ideas off
                        each other. Eventually Lensing would pick up and learn guitar to accompany himself, sonically shifting to more acoustic style.
                    </p>

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        Dealing with the recent divorce of his parents, and taking therapy; writing songs became extremely cathartic to him. Doing the two at the same time really made him a lot less afraid to share his feelings and, led him to realize that songwriting was benefiting
                        him tremendously. He decided he wanted to embrace his vulnerability, rather than shy away from it.
                    </p>

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        Eventually Lensing moved to Portland, Oregon to attend college with the end goal of becoming an English teacher and hoping music would work out on the side. As he studied he became even more passionate about being a musician, whilst deciding music was
                        something he needed to make a priority if we wanted to it to be his vocation. A long time fan of the Colorado music scene, with artists like Gregory Alan Isakov and Nathaniel Rateliff, John decided to move to Denver to pursue music.
                    </p>

                    <p class="not-flow-tex">
                        The songwriter now resides in Denver studying music business, building his audience, honing in on his songwriting, and working towards his goals.
